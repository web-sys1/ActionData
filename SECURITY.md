## Reporting a Vulnerability

It uses this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

## Problem to solve

Standardize the security reporting process in open source projects as there is no current standard process to privately disclose potential security vulnerabilities to project maintainers.  Additionally, most open source projects do not provide information on how to disclose potential security vulnerabilities.
